# Pronouns in English-language fiction
This project uses the ['Syntactic N-grams' corpus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PWeoTkrnKk9H8_7CfVbdvuoFZ7jYivNTkBX2Hj7qLw/), based on the Google Books corpus and based on parse fragments annotated with Penn-Treebank part-of-speech (POS) tags, to discover and validate the pronouns found.
