# Pronouns in English-language fiction
This project uses the ['Syntactic Ngrams' corpus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PWeoTkrnKk9H8_7CfVbdvuoFZ7jYivNTkBX2Hj7qLw/), based on the Google Books corpus and containing parse fragments with [Penn-Treebank part-of-speech (POS) tags](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html), to discover and validate the pronouns contained and tagged therein.

## Methodology

The first challenge in approaching this problem is the broken link to the Syntactic Ngrams corpus. It is, however, still contained in a [cache](https://web.archive.org/web/20210621193950/https://storage.googleapis.com/books/syntactic-ngrams/index.html) via the Internet Archive.

## Acknowledgements

The Syntactic Ngrams corpus is documented in Goldberg and Orwant (ACL 2013) [[1]](#1).

This analysis was aided by the authors of Hoyle et al., (ACL 2019) [[2]](#2).
