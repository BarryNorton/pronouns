# Pronouns in English-language fiction
This project uses the ['Syntactic N-grams' corpus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PWeoTkrnKk9H8_7CfVbdvuoFZ7jYivNTkBX2Hj7qLw/), based on the Google Books corpus and based on parse fragments annotated with [Penn-Treebank part-of-speech (POS) tags](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2003/ling001/penn_treebank_pos.html), to discover and validate the pronouns contained and tagged therein.
